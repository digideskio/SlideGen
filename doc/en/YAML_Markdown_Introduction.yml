  content:
    - YAML is short of "YAML Ain't a Markup Language"
    - SlideGen uses YAML as input. You can write a YAML file, and SlideGen compile it to *HTML Slides*.
    - It just like XML or json to serialize object to text file.:
      - However, YAML is more data-oriented
      - YAML is more Readable.
      - Its line and whitespace delimiters have certen meaning like Python.
    - As the Zen of Python Says::
      - Beautiful is better than ugly.
      - Readability counts.

  content:
    - Here will show a YAML document. This document is actually used by SlideGen as Input. Use this block of YAML document, SlideGen can generate previous slide.

        **Notice!** In YAML, it's better to use space not tab to make indent.

  content:
    - Lists:
      - The list uses a hyphen+space to begin a new item in list.
      - |
          <pre><code>- apple
          - banana
          - peach</code></pre>
    - Associative arrays:
      - Keys are separated from values by a colon+space.
      - Like:: |
          <pre><code>name: John Smith
          age: 33</code></pre>
      - It means <pre><code>{name:John Smith, age:33}</code></code>

    - String: 
      - String literal need not quote by ""
      - |
          There are many reserve word for YAML in String literal like *, >, |, etc. You can use | or > in YAML to write raw string.
      - |
          Sample Code:
          <pre><code>raw_string: | # or you can use > here. it is comments here
              \*My Email\* is I@reyoung.me</code></pre>
      - |
          When you use '>', it will ignore the new line. Double new line(\n) are converted to one new line. The '|' is what you write is what it is.
    - Comments:
      - |
          Comments begin with the number sign (#), can start anywhere on a line, and continue until the end of the line.

      Notice that the lists and associative arrays can contains other element as children.

      Such as:
      <pre><code>men: 
        - John Smith
        - Bill Jones:
          email: bill_jones@somesite.com
          description: |
            an sample description for Bill Jones.
      women:
        - Mary Smith
        - Susan Williams</code></pre>

      Also, YAML contains a powerful feature. It just like pointer in C.
      
      <pre><code>data01: &id01
        content: "Some Simple Data"
      data08: *id01 # Refer to data01
      </code></pre>
